      "2. Verbs and Adjectives play a crucial role in identifying properties. Verbs often indicate actions or relations between entities, suggesting object properties in an ontology. For instance, the verb \"has\" in \"hasColor\" implies a possession relation, making it suitable for an object or data property, depending on its use. Adjectives, like \"red\" in \"The cup is red,\" describe attributes and are perfect for data properties. So, \"red\" would help us decide that the hasColor property should link a cup instance to the color \"Red.\"\n",
      "3. When dealing with Compound Names like \"hasColor,\" it's essential to break them down. \"HasColor\" combines \"has\" (a verb) and \"Color\" (a noun), indicating a property that describes an attribute (color) of an entity (like a cup). This compound name tells us it's a data property because it links an entity to a data value, not another entity.\n",
      "4. Finally, we must Consider Context and Semantic Roles. The meaning of words can change with context, and their roles in sentences (subject, object, predicate) help clarify these meanings. For instance, \"flies\" can mean different things in \"The bird flies\" versus \"Time flies.\" By analyzing semantic roles alongside POS tags, we can better map words to ontology elements accurately.\n",
